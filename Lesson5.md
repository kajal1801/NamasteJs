# Shortest Javascript program

The shortest javascript program is the empty file of js.

```

// No code

```

Although the file is empty, js engine works behind the scenes. It creates a global execution context, global object and creates something known as window which is pointed by the this keyword.

`Global space is the space outside functions in a js code`

Whenever we create any variables or functions in the global space they get attached to the window.
